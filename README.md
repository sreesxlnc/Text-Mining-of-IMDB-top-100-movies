Document Clustering &amp; Topic modeling

This project is to identify the latent structures within the synopses of the top 100 films of all time. It involves the following steps

. tokenizing and stemming each synopsis
. transforming the corpus into vector space using tf-idf
. calculating cosine distance between each document as a measure of similarity
. clustering the documents using the k-means algorithm
. using multidimensional scaling to reduce dimensionality within the corpus
. conducting a hierarchical clustering on the corpus using Ward clustering
. plotting a Ward dendrogram
. topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Data folder contains the text files required to run the code. Future additions will include how these files are created using web scraping.
